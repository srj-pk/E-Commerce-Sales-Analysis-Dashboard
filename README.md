## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of a large ecommerce platform selling 25,000+ products through multiple vendors nationwide. The objective was to create an analytical dashboard for the Sales Team to:

* Track overall sales performance
* Analyze vendor-wise and item-wise contribution
* Identify underperforming products
* Visualize sales trends and distribution patterns

The dashboard was built using **three Excel datasets**:

1. **2021Sales.xls** – Order data including OrderID, Date, ItemID, Quantity, and Sales Amount
2. **Item-Vendor.xls** – Mapping of items to vendors
3. **Vendor-Manager.xls** – Mapping of vendors to sales managers

---

## 🗂 Data Model

A clean **star schema** was developed consisting of:

* **Fact Table** – Sales transactions
* **Dimension Tables** – Vendors, Items, Sales Managers
* Relationships connected using ItemID and VendorID

---

## 🎯 Key Features & Insights

### 🔹 Dynamic Slicers

* Vendor
* Sales Manager
* Date Range

### 🔹 14-Day Moving Average (Last 3 Months)

A dual-line chart displaying:

* Daily Sales
* 14-Day moving average
* Responsive to slicers

**DAX Example:**

```
14-Day Moving Avg =
AVERAGEX(
    DATESINPERIOD('Date'[Date], MAX('Date'[Date]), -14, DAY),
    [Total Sales]
)
```

---

### 🔹 Period Slicer (7d / 14d / 28d)

A separate visual showing short-term sales trends:

* Only responds to the period slicer
* Ignores all report-level filters
* Created using `REMOVEFILTERS` and `ALL` for isolation

---

### 🔹 Box Plot – Top 10 Vendor Sales Distribution

Using AppSource visual to show:

* Min
* Max
* Median
* Quartiles
* Spread of daily vendor performance

---

### 🔹 Second Best-Selling Item Per Vendor (RankX Table)

Custom calculated table using `RANKX`:

```
Second Best Item =
FILTER(
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        SUMMARIZE(
            Sales,
            Vendor[VendorName],
            Item[ItemID],
            "TotalSales", [Total Sales]
        ),
        "Rank", RANKX(
            CALCULATETABLE(
                SUMMARIZE(Sales, Item[ItemID])
            ),
            [Total Sales],
            ,
            DESC
        )
    ),
    [Rank] = 2
)
```

Manually validated for accuracy using Excel.
